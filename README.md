AdventureGame
=============

This code uses pygame to create an adventure game GUI. 

Right now, there is an image that moves around the screen.  If the 
center of the moving image passes inside another image's boundary,
a point is gained.  Holding down arrow keys currently keeps the image
in motion until a boundary of the background is reached.
